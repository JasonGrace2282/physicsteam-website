subtitle: A Conducive Working Environment Like No Other
description: >
  We offer engaging lectures, collaborative problem solving sessions, and challenging problem sets.
  Physics Team is geared towards all students who want to build upon their physics knowledge. We also
  encourage these dedicated students to participate in competitions such as the National Physics Olympiad
  and Physics Bowl. In fact, Physics Team has a proud history of producing more members of the US Physics
  Team than any other high school in the nation. Join us every Friday A and B Block during 8th period!
  Since we cater lectures to students' varying abilities, you can be sure to take away new insights every week.

      - name: A Team
        description: >
          A Team is designed for post-AP Physics students who have already learned or know the traditional classical
          mechanics that is taught here at TJ. The primary purpose of A Team is to rigorously train students for higher
          level competitions such as the USAPhO semifinalist exam in the US Physics Olympiad. We offer lectures and
          challenging problem sets on post-AP mechanics topics, as well as material not covered in AP Physics like
          thermodynamics, special relativity, optics, waves, and electrodynamics. A fairly deep understanding of
          multivariable calculus is recommended, but is not required as it will be taught on the go.

      - name: B Team
        description: >
          B Team is designed for AP Physics students who are looking for help or a supplement to their AP Physics class.
          For the first half of the year, we will have lectures and problem sets that focus on mechanics in accordance
          with the AP Physics course. We will also spend some time going deeper than AP Physics in certain areas, and
          prepare students for the mechanics-based F=ma Exam, which is the equivalent of the AMC 12 exam in the US
          Physics Olympiad. For the second half of the year, we will cover electricity and magnetism and review for the
          AP exam in May.

      - name: C Team
        description: >
          C Team is designed to foster physics interest in those who have little to no experience in physics. This team is
          based more on understanding physics from an experimental point of view through demonstrations. C Team topics include
          a brief introduction to topics covered in TJ Physics courses like Physics 1 and AP Physics, as well as additional
          topics such as optics and thermodynamics. Knowledge of calculus is not required for this team. In addition, C Team
          also works with our Outreach Committee to organize physics demonstrations at community events.
