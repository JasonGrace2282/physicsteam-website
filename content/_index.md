We offer engaging lectures, collaborative problem solving sessions, and challenging problem sets.
Physics Team is geared towards all students who want to build upon their physics knowledge. We also
encourage these dedicated students to participate in competitions such as the National Physics Olympiad
and Physics Bowl. In fact, Physics Team has a proud history of producing more members of the US Physics
Team than any other high school in the nation. Join us every Friday A and B Block during 8th period!
Since we cater lectures to students' varying abilities, you can be sure to take away new insights every week.
